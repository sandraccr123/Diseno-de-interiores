<h5>DIRECTOR + INTERIOR DESIGNER DID</h5>
<h3><tt>SARA HERNANDEZ</tt></h3>
<p>SHIFT’s Creative Director and Principal Interior Designer, Jamie Deck, is an award-winning graduate of the Malaspina University College design program. She’s always buzzing with creative energy and ideas that push the envelope of traditional design. A lover of sports and art since she was a child, her mind is as active as her body which lends itself to her passion for spaces that support the ways in which we move and create.</p>
<p>Inspired by her dad’s innate passion for architecture and design, Jamie’s interior design vocation is in her blood. Her education in design and career-building work at an architectural firm led towards her 2007 “shift” into interior design. Her entrepreneurial and collaborative spirit  led to her found SHIFT Interiors over a decade ago.</p>

<h3><tt>ANDREA MALDONADO</tt></h3>
<h5><tt>INTERIOR DESIGNER DID</tt></h5>
<p>Julia gravitated towards SHIFT after completing her credentials in Interior Design at VCAD. Born in France but raised in Vancouver with an architect father, she has always had a deep interest in space design (and champagne). Her European roots influence her minimalist style, sparking the incorporation of more classic design elements and providing a dynamism to SHIFT’s collective.</p>

<p>Shayna’s warm personality and “yes” attitude makes her our go-to-girl for client communications and SHIFT’s social side. Her colourful background in theatrics and the fine arts has given her the ability to exercise both sides of her brain effortlessly. She runs installs like a well-oiled machine, tasking needs for our business to run efficiently. A hard-worker, SHIFT is lucky to have her as an extension of our team and appreciates what she brings to the table. </p>
